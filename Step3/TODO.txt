I'm pretty bad at throwing exceptions I found out... I could use some help throwing Parse Exceptions within STListener.java.

Also, I went under the assumption that only INTs and FLOATs can be passed as parameters to functions (because thats what all the test inputs have)

Feel free to change anything you don't like. I think I did everything correctly but if you guys have any other ideas or thoughts feel free to get wild.
